# Horiseon Public Website

## Assets have been refactored to meet accessibility standards

This project refactors Horiseon's public website HTML, providing semantic structure and compliance with accessiblity requirements.

We've modified divs and selector types to improve readability while consolidating duplicated code (DRY).
